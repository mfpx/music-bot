# LÃºcio Music Bot
Welcome! This Discord bot was primarily made for practice, therefore it's incomplete and I will not offer any support if you decide to use it.  
I am, however, happy to help you understand the code and help you learn.  
I used the template provided by [kkrypt0nn](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn) to have the "bare-bones" working prior to writing my own code.  
# Legal notice
The `youtube` cog is against YouTube's ToS, and you will likely receive a legal notice from them if you decide to run this yourself.  
Code in this repository was created primarily for practice of developing using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), while adding other software to it.  
Using [youtube_dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) was the easiest solution as there were plenty of examples provided.  

Additionally, the [youtube_dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) team (with support from [EFF](https://eff.org/)) has already fought a legal battle against YouTube, and have won. The reasoning for providing this code freely follows a similar mantra - it serves a legitimate purpose, but can also be abused. Therefore, I offer this for practice and educational purposes. I aim to comment the entire codebase, to help anyone using the code.
